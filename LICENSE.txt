While Splunk can listen for syslog data directly, for large implementation is it recommended to stand up dedicated collection infrastructure with a Universal forwarder for data forwarding to the indexer tier.

This app provides monitoring dashboards and sample configuration for two popular collection mechanisms based on:
- rsyslog
- syslog-ng

This project is hosted on GitHub, see https://github.com/hire-vladimir/SA-syslog_collection

Collaborators wanted!!!
